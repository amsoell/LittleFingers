LittleFingers
=============

Touch friendly iOS Video Player

LittleFingers is the iOS video player you can feel good about letting your toddler use. We all try to minimize the screen time of our little ones, but the fact is sometimes we just need to keep them entertained for a while. iPads and iPhones are great for this, with one major problem: It's too easy for little ones to touch the screen and pause the show, or swipe away to other applications.

That's where LittleFingers comes in.

LittleFingers is the video player that you can lock down. Once you start playing a video and lock the screen, tapping the screen does nothing. Your little one can poke, swipe, and tap all they want without interrupting the show. When you're ready to end the video, a simple series of swipes—three fingers, two fingers, then one finger—will unlock it.

_Update June 2015_: iOS has largely added many features that made LittleFingers so great through it's accessibility settings, so LittleFingers is being retired. The code is being open sourced under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). I hope someone finds it useful, if you have any questions feel free to file an issue.
